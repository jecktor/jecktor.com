I've never been good at writing, yet I’ve been doing so for as long as I can remember. To me, it's like one of those hobbies people do because it's sort of therapeutic to them, but they never actually take the time to become good at it.

I’ll never forget the countless nights I spent staying up until the wee hours of the morning writing crappy Wattpad-quality stories and doodling on the back of my notebooks back when I was in middle school. As bad as they were, none of those stories ever got finished, though. I’d always get bored of them and start something new.

Wrapping up hobby projects has always been one of my biggest struggles, and it’s not just limited to writing. Almost every time I start working on a new project, at first I’ll keep coming back to it at least a couple of times a week. However, as time goes by and motivation starts to fade, I find myself starting another project without even looking back at the pile of previous unfinished ones _(my side project directory has over 20 entries)._

In order to get out of this vicious circle, I’ve decided something. From now on, I’m going to write at least one entry on this blog every month. I know it doesn’t seem like much, but cut me some slack.

To be honest, most entries are just going to be me rambling about whatever ends up crossing my mind, since at the end of the day, I’m doing this for myself. That, and because I still romanticize the idea of an open web, where everyone has their little corner on the internet.
