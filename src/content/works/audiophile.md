Audiophile is an e-commerce website for a fictional audio equipment store. It was built for a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) challenge, which provided the design and assets.

The challenge itself was to build a website as close to the design as possible and to make it responsive, but I decided to take it a step further and make a fully functional e-commerce website.

There's product searching and a cart system that uses [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) as a backend, though it doesn't do any actual payment processing or user authentication.

This was the first time I used most of the technologies in this project, at least in a real-world scenario. It took me a while to get used to the whole Next.js and TypeScript thing, since I was so used to installing and configuring everything myself using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) _(this was before I discovered [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/))_ and using plain JavaScript. But once I got the hang of it, I couldn't imagine ever going back to a sea of endless `.conf.js` files, and `undefined is not a function` errors.

I was also pleasantly surprised by Tailwind CSS's simplicity and how much it improved my workflow _(considering that beforehand I thought inline CSS was a significant step back from [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/))._
